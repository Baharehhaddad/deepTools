2.0

 * Documentation improved and migrated to http://deeptools.readthedocs.org
 * Allow multiple bigwig files in computeMatrix that can be clustered together
 * computeMatrix now accepts multiple bed files. Each bed file is considered as a group. Labels are automatically
   added based on the file names.
 * When computing read coverage now splited reads are understood. This is convenient for computing the
   coverage of for RNA-seq data.
 * New quality control tool 'plotCoverage' to plot the coverage over base pairs for multiple samples
 * renaming of --missingDataAsZero to --skipNonCovered regions for clarity in bamCoverage and bamCompare
 * New analysis tool plotPCA that visualizes the results from principal component analysis
 * New option in bamCoverage `--MNase` that will compute the read coverage only considering 2 base pairs at the
   center of the fragment.
 * Make read extension optional. Remove the need to specify a default fragment length for most of the tools. When
   read extension is enabled and the bam files contain paired en data, the mean fragment length is calculated by
   sampling the read pairs in the bam file.
 * Dramatically improved bigwig related tools by using the new pyBigWig module. Eliminated the requirement for the
   UCSC program `bigWigInfo`
 * renamed heatmapper to plotHeatmap and profiler to plotProfile
 * added hierarchical clustering, besides k-means to plotProfile and plotHeatmap
 * improved plotting features for plotProfile when using 'overlapped_lines' and 'heatmap' plot types
 * Resolved an error introduced by numpy version 1.10 in computeMatrix
 * plotting of correlations (from bamCorrelate or bigwigCorrelate) was separated from the computation of the
   underlying data. A new tool, plotCorrelation was added. This tool can plot correlations as heatmaps or as scatter
   plots and includes options to adjust a large array of visual features.
 * Fixed issue with bed intervals in bigwigCorrelate and bamCorrelate and a user specified region.
 * Correlation coefficients can be computed even if the data contains NaNs

1.5.9:
* Fixed problem with pseudocounts. The original implementation was scaling pseudocounts twice, which resulted in unexpected results for regions with zero reads.
* The tools bigWigCorrelate and bamPEFragmentSize where added to galaxy.
* Added parameter missingDataAsZero to bamCoverage. The default behaviour is unchanged.
* Improved error reporting of bamCorrelate when few bins are computed.
